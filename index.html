              <h3>What was your thought process when selecting your major?</h3>
              <br>
              <p>I have always been interested in technology and making things, so computer science was a no brainer. I
                knew
                I
                wanted to create something and put it on the web, like my corner of the internet. This really compelled
                me
                to
                start taking coding more seriously. I started coding when I was 14, but it was only the basic syntax
                with
                no
                real-life application. Recently, around 6 months ago I embarked on the journey of becoming a full stack
                react
                developer. </p>

              <h3>Tell me about a time you failed at something. </h3>
              <br>
              <p>It was the last week to turn in any late assignments at my school. I had accumulated several late
                assignments
                and was struggling to get them done. It was my lack of self-discipline that led me to this situation in
                the
                first place. If I had just procrastinated a little less, this would not have happened. Nevertheless, I
                ended
                up turning in sub-standard work and missed one or two labs, netting me a poor grade in the class. So, I
                took
                this experience and used it to become better at managing my time. </p>

              <p>No one wants to be the bearer of bad news, but direct communication would be best in this situation. I
                would
                sit down and talk to them about what is causing the poor performance. If there are underlying issues, we
                would
                create a plan to tackle these issues. Frequent follow-ups need to occur, because if no one is following
                through with the plan nothing is going to change. </p>

              <h3>How many pennies would it take to reach from the ground to the top of the Empire State Building?</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Calculating the number of pennies it would take if simple, you take the height of the empire state
                building
                and divided by the thickness of the penny. There are a couple of other factors though. Tiny debris on
                the
                side
                of the penny can cause the stack to lean, then needing more pennies to get to the top. Irregularity of
                the
                pennis can also increase or decrease the amount needed. The wind is also a factor, but if we are going
                to
                talk
                about the wind, we might as well talk about stacking the pennies vertically. </p>
